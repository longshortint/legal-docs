<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: June 11, 2025</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Long Short Int, LLC ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile app, Logit.</p>

<h2>Zero Storage of User Data</h2>
<p>We do not store any of your receipt images or extracted data on our servers. All receipt images are processed temporarily via our cloud backend and then discarded immediately after data extraction. The extracted data remains only on your device unless explicitly exported by you.</p>
<p>We only retain non-identifiable diagnostic logs (e.g., crash reports, error messages) for up to 30 days for troubleshooting purposes.</p>

<h2>Information Temporarily Processed</h2>
<p>While using Logit, we temporarily process the following types of information to provide the app's functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Receipt images uploaded or scanned by the user</li>
  <li>Extracted fields (amount, date, vendor, category)</li>
  <li>App usage logs (diagnostic only, no PII)</li>
  <li>A randomly generated device identifier and a temporary API key</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<p>We use this data solely to provide and improve the app experience, such as organizing receipts and troubleshooting via logs.</p>

<h2>Data Processing and Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use third-party services such as AWS Lambda and OpenAI to process receipt images and extract data. Your data is shared with these services only to perform the core functionality of the app. These providers have their own privacy policies which govern their handling of your data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/" target="_blank">AWS Privacy Notice</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. This includes encrypted data transmission using HTTPS and restricted access to internal logs. However, no method of transmission or storage over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Receipt images are temporarily processed through our cloud infrastructure and are not stored permanently. Once extraction is complete and the data is returned to your device, the image is discarded from our processing pipeline. Application logs are retained for up to 30 days and automatically deleted.</p>

<h2>Use of Device Identifiers</h2>
<p>To support secure communication with our backend services, we store a randomly generated device identifier and API key in our system. This identifier does not contain or reveal any personal information and cannot be used to trace the userâ€™s identity. All such data is automatically deleted after a limited period.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>For any questions or concerns, contact <a href="mailto:support@longshortint.com">support@longshortint.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by updating the 'Effective Date' at the top of this page and posting the revised version here. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of Washington, United States.</p>
